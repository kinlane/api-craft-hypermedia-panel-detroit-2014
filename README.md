**Title:** State of Hypermedia Today

* What is the state of hypermedia?
* How did we get here?
* Where are we going?
* Where should we be going?
* What can we do during hackathon?
* What are two things everyone should leave API-Craft thinking about?
  * adding hypermedia to an API is a way to improve the API's usability ([@mamund](https://twitter.com/mamund))
  * the more hypermedia information in a response, the more stateless that response can be ([@mamund](https://twitter.com/mamund))
  * Hypermedia allows us to go beyond CRUD-influenced API design, enabling a task-based message design consisting of current resource state and available transitions.  This provides a richer interaction model between client and server.  ([@kevinswiber](https://twitter.com/kevinswiber))
  * The best way to improve the state of the art is to see hypermedia applied to more use cases and have feedback shared publicly with the community. ([@kevinswiber](https://twitter.com/kevinswiber))
  * What are the metrics of success for your API? How do hypermedia designs contribute to or detract from those metrics? ([@mikekelly85](https://twitter.com/mikekelly85))
  * Are more complicated media types, that require more than an HTTP library and a JSON parser to deal with, moving away from the "simplicity" that has been driving web API adoption over SOAP?  ([@mikekelly85](https://twitter.com/mikekelly85))
