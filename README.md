Title: State of Hypermedia Today

* What is the state of hypermedia?
* How did we get here?
* Where are we going?
* Where should we be going?
* What can we do during hackathon?
* What should everyone leave API-Craft thinking about?
  * Mike Amundsen
    * adding hypermedia to an API is a way to improve the API's usability
    * the more hypermedia information in a response, the more stateless that response can be.
